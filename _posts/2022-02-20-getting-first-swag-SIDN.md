## How I get my first SWAG from SIDN (Sensitive Data Expose)

**بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم**

## Introduction

Assalamu Alaikum 
(Peace Be Upon You)

I am Mehedi Hasan Remon. 
Student of Computer Science Engineering. I am learning about Web Penetration Testing and doing Bug Bounty as a side activity.

Let's start the story

## Background

I just weak up and start scrolling on my Facebook timeline. I saw someone posted in the Bug Bounty Poc group that he got a SWAG from SIDN for reporting a vulnerability. That T-Shirt was really awesome and I also have a friend [**Asif Farabi**](https://www.facebook.com/asiffarabi000) who has that same SWAG from SIDN. So my mind said 
“Let’s Give it a Shot”

## How I found the Bug

I fire up my Kali Linux, start my recon with [**Sublist3r**](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r)

From Sublist3r I found an interesting domain called 
mailman.sidn.nl

After playing around the target I found a directory called 
mailman.sidn.nl/pipermail
But there was a 403 for that directory

But then I put a ‘/’ after the pipermail directory 
Like This: mailman.sidn.nl/pipermail/

Boom … 
It takes me inside the directory. Inside that directory, I found lots of private emails about the company. like their product relates emails, production emails, internal dev mails, etc.

Then immediately I send them that Bug Report and asked Allah for the success

And then
Alhamdulillah (all praise is due to Allah)
Got this sweet SWAG
