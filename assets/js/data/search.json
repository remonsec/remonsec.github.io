Last week I get some bounties by doing my recon with Spyse. Let me share my experience with youMass AttackSo last time we saw some mass subdomain takeoverwhat about other issues ! let me share a query that Markroze shared with mewe can search for specific things. like here we have WATTrouter service you can do more query like jira, openvpn, wordpress so and so onBut this act can be extremely evil hacking on random assets makes no sense.Now it’s time to filter those things to find out websites with responsible disclosure policyDownload your search result in CSV format, cut the end url and bruteforce the list with some common disclosure endpoint You may need a pro account to download your search result.After that you can FUZZ like this to get out all hosts with disclosure programNOTE: FFUF -mr flag not working properly for me. If you face similar let me know, btw you can do similar with bash, python . . .Okay enough. we are done with mass attack things. do your own research to find out more interesting query and attacks.Recon your TargetAfter searching your target you will see things in crawler section. there’s a panel called related. that one really helps. you will see similar data there like if any other host is using similar icon of your target websiteYou will be getting AWS buckets that target company use to host assets. Now you can look for access control issues for those buckets. you will also get interesting 3rd party hosting services that your target may using for their asset hosting or any other work. so those 3rd party hosts also can lead security issue for your targetIf you move into DNS history &amp; related category again you will see some options there to look into. This feature of Spyse helped me to earn some $cash last weekwebapp hosted on server from Canada was secure but same webapp hosted from US server was vulnerable with multiple server side attacks. That program was live from 2014. In 2021 they resolved 10 reports 6 of them is mine.No one was looking there so it was easy for me to find bugs.I attached all reward and resource screenshot as reference material. You should not believe in a random boy from internet at all. There should some kind of proof what I am saying.Now some will show offence that I am doing show off, if I don’t attach screenshot then also some will show offence that I am not telling the truth.Whatever I am leaving it to you, you can show love or hate it’s your choice I am already broken so it make no changes to me :)Those are things I found interesting for BugBounty hunters on Spyse. You also can look into your own for other features. This recon writeup series sponsored by Spyse. They offered me their pro account to use and let them know my feedback about their service.You can see it your own how I used Spyse for BugBounty stuff and earned some cash. Thanks Spyse for the sponsorship and your amazing serviceI am ending this writeup here. If you have any question you can ask me on Twitter at this handle remonsec. If you have general questions then instead of DM you can mention me on your tweet. So other also may get benefit from your question or if I don’t know the answare I may mention someone who knowsHave a sweet day everyoneAllah Hafizwanna support my work! well just buy me a coffee" }, { "title": "Passive Recon with Spyse (Part-I)", "url": "/posts/passive-recon-with-spyse-part-I/", "categories": "Bugbounty", "tags": "bugbounty", "date": "2022-02-20 00:00:00 +0600", "snippet": "Passive Recon with Spyse (Part-I)بسم الله الرحمن الرحيمAssalamu Alaikumpeace be upon youIntroductionWelcome guys, today I will be talking about recon &amp; spyse.

How can you do your recon with spyse &amp; why ! will it help or what ?ReconRecon is nothing just a process to gather information about your target. While doing bugbounty, performing recon over your target will be beneficial.SpyseSpyse is an internet assets search engine. while doing bugbounty spyse can be your passive recon tool. How to use spyse for your passive recon ! let me show youSpyse ToolsIf you visit https://spyse.com/tools you will see the tooling section for spyse. From there you can get a idea what type of enumeration it perform and how can you collect your searched dataFEATURED TOOLS Advance Search Customize your search to find any target. API Get the data via Spyse API. Bulk Search Make multiple searching for a list of targeted domains and IPs simultaneously. DATA GATHERING Domain Lookup Explore detailed information about a domain DNS Lookup Find all DNS records for any domain ASN Lookup Find Autonomous System Numbers with connected data Subdomain Finder Find subdomains of any domain Reverse DNS Lookup Find a DNS PTR record of any IPv4 address SSL Certificate Lookup Find certificates by a domain name or fingerprint IP Lookup Find geolocation, open ports and hosted domains on the IP MX Lookup Find MX records by the domain name Reverse AdSense Lookup Find all domains with the same AdSense ID Reverse IP Lookup Find all hosted domains on a specific IP address NS Lookup Get a full DNS records list of a domain Company Lookup Find related company assets by its name Port Scanner Find open ports and vulnerabilities WHOIS Lookup Find WHOIS record for any domain CVE Search Find vulnerable domains and IP addresses by CVE ID Technology Checker Search for technologies on the websites. So as you can see here a lot to do with spyse.Advance SearchHere you can see spyse have around 4.8B data collection. So with advance search you can filter the data from their collection and can collect specific data you need.Let me give you a practical example by searching for all possible subdomain takeover on GitHub serviceHope this example is clear that how you can use spyse advance search feature to request specific data and use it for your own benefit.NOTE: hacking randomly like this can be dangerousEndNoteI am little bit sick &amp; can’t write more. I am closing this write up here, whatever there a lot more to cover about spyse &amp; recon.

The word government was the killer one.So now what, I need this swag badly. But wait, i just get started few weeks ago even don’t know how to run burpsuite. As like all other newbie i DM that guy for the tip how he got that. Then he just gave me a github repo and told me to try harder. Seriously man i was expecting he will give me something by running that script i will get the swag, at least some secret method. But what he gave me a list of domain for Dutch Gov websites. Here is the repo. It contain 650+ host to find bugs.My ApproachIf i be honest i was so confuse coz i have to look into 650+ host and i dont know how to do basic vulnerability assesment. So i just reported some SPF &amp; Clickjack but no luck they close as N/A. Fine, i have to do something else. After passing couple of days i understood that, with this knowledge it’s not possible to break into their security. I took a step back and start learning about some basics. Please note that during that whole week i visited most of that websites and saw that there is no authentication for those hosts so it means no more authentication related easy bugs. From a beginner point of view, it just sound insane and damn hard to hit. But we don’t care how hard it is right !During that break time i start learning about Recon. Yes, you hear it right recon. This PentesterLand resources just worked awesome for me. I read all of them, every single one. After study couple of weeks i got a good basic understanding about how to approach a target in generalFinal MethodologySo we have lot’s of hosts with no authentication. So i call this workflow is, fly over the targetGet Only Live Hostswhile read domain; do if host “$domain” &gt; /dev/null; then echo $domain;fi;done&lt;DutchGov.txt &gt;&gt; domains.txtGet All Subdomainfor sub in $(cat domains.txt);do subfinder -d $sub -o $sub.dutch;doneGather All Subdomaincat *.dutch &gt; all.subFuzz All The Thingsfor i in $(cat all.sub); do echo””; echo “Subdomain of $i”;echo “”;gobuster dir -w wordlist.txt -u $i -e -o tmp ;cat tmp &gt;&gt; dutch.fuzz; echo “”; doneServer Details for CVEfor sub in $(cat all.sub);do echo “[*] Domain Name is =&gt; “ $sub;echo “[*] Server Header is =&gt; “ $(http — verify=no -h $sub | grep Server);echo “ “;doneScan Portswell when i was doing i have done this process with nmap manually, i only scanned those hosts where i found juicy staff during previous stepsBut now there lots of fast scanner available to automate this process. I didn’t check them yet, so do some research yourselfWeb ScreensShotI already have visited all of those sites so no need for me, but you can tryYou may notice i didn’t check for any parameter or any kind of Injection attack. The truth is, that time i actually didn’t know how to test parameters. If you want you can follow this oneWayback Machine Urlscat domains.txt | waybackurls | urlprobe -t 50 -c 100 | grep “=”End StoryI had a vps so for me it was not that much hard to do. every nigh i run them with tmux and in morning i got juicy staff.

Student of Computer Science Engineering. I am learning about Web Penetration Testing and doing Bug Bounty as a side activity.Let’s start the storyBackgroundI just weak up and start scrolling on my Facebook timeline. I saw someone posted in the Bug Bounty Poc group that he got a SWAG from SIDN for reporting a vulnerability. That T-Shirt was really awesome and I also have a friend Asif Farabi who has that same SWAG from SIDN. So my mind said “Let’s Give it a Shot”How I found the BugI fire up my Kali Linux, start my recon with Sublist3rFrom Sublist3r I found an interesting domain called mailman.sidn.nlAfter playing around the target I found a directory called mailman.sidn.nl/pipermailBut there was a 403 for that directoryBut then I put a ‘/’ after the pipermail directory Like This: mailman.sidn.nl/pipermail/Boom … It takes me inside the directory. Inside that directory, I found lots of private emails about the company. like their product relates emails, production emails, internal dev mails, etc.Then immediately I send them that Bug Report and asked Allah for the successAnd thenAlhamdulillah (all praise is due to Allah)Got this sweet SWAGBug POCConclusionThanks for reading till the end.

I assume you already know the basics now struggling to get your first bug.In part-1 I explained two different categories of BugBounty. That’s the thing everyone was hiding. I am not inspiring or demotivating with those categories. I am just showing beginners a clear pitcher of BugBounty. that’s allI see from Twitter everyone is interested in Active BugBounty stuff. So today I will focus more on thatPassive BugBountyPassive BugBounty is kind of passive earning something like that. Invest time &amp; energy and get back the result. Most of the time people with no infosec interest or people with no basic knowledge about infosec start BugBounty passively. But yes you will see top pro hunters doing passive BugBounty as well. But their setup and understanding is another level. They use to put all of their past experience and skill to build a master passive workflow for them. Don’t even expect something from today’s writeup. Today’s passive workflow will be easy and simple.Workflow Subdomain Takeover Nuclei Scan As Nuclei will cover most of the known surface level bugs, so I don’t think I should waste my time writing all those bugs here one by one. But then why I mentioned Subdomain Takeover differently! Well let’s have a lookI have done some research before writing this write-up. I tried both passive &amp; active hunting on my own to experience the real environment that beginners will face with those ideas. To make you feel good I want to say that I found bugs with both the Active and Passive BugBounty method, also earned some cash $$$ for my findings. Sounds cool at least for me xDSubdomain TakeoverThis bug is nothing just telling companies that, hey you are no longer using that service for your subdomain. I am using this on behalf of you. Now shut up and pay me for not abusingAll you have to do pick a massive amount of targets &amp; gather as much subdomain as you can. Run multiple subdomain takeover scanners and verify them on your own manually.I tried with bash, by creating a shell script that takes a large amount of domain as input and enumerates subdomains, checks for takeover &amp; stores the data for manual verification. You don’t have to go that far just make sure you have a good amount of target to check their subdomain takeover issuesAs you can see It scanned over 984 domains and end up having 20 detections and after manually verifying the amount was less than that. But hey It works. I found one takeover on Amazon but Subdomain Takeover on Amazon was out of scope, I didn’t notice that but it was their core subdomain so they resolved it but didn’t pay any bounty for my findingGot some over self-hosted Responsible Disclosure Programs. Takeovers on Heroku, AWS, GitHub was common there &amp; received bounties as wellIf you target small companies like this your chance is high to get paid out there. You will get several BugBounty google dork on GitHub use them or make your ownIf you want to go with platforms like HackerOne BugCrowd then I recommend going with external programs. Like they are not listed on HackerOne directly they may invite after reporting on their security email. then they pay the reward from HackerOne directly. You can take Mcafee as an example. As people don’t know much about those external programs it’s a good place to make hands dirtyNuclei ScanWell, this is also going to be the same as like Subdomain Takeover workflow. Make sure you have a massive amount of targets that’s allBuild a similar bash script for Nuclei scan that take targets as input and check for issues and store the resultYou are going to have issues like log file disclosure, config file disclosure, Jira wp issues, basic misconfiguration, etc. Most of the time you are just going to have low issues that the company even doesn’t care about. But at some point, you will receive some small to big bounties depend on the bug you haveHere I scanned once and got some low, medium issues. Also received bounties as well, the payout was so low thoI just can’t report those low-hanging fruits again &amp; again so wrote some templates to automate the reporting part as well. I don’t want to waste my time in those areasNoteI even don’t know where those programs came from. I didn’t even visit any of those sites to see how they look like. I tried with python to build a scraping tool but I failed for my poor programming knowledge, then I just somehow manage to build one with bash and fetching data from some GraphQL DB as well. Don’t inbox me how I did that. This is something I like to keep in my secret box, but will expose in the future for sure :)Active BugBountyNow the real hacking &amp; fun start from here. If I am honest I didn’t enjoy while doing passive BugBounty. That kinda boring and not challenging as anyone can do those things. I just passed 1 day to build that scarping tool and 10–20 minutes for subdomain takeover and nuclei automation script. that’s all. it took 2-3 days to scan over all the targets and then took 1–2 hours to report them. Learned nothing, My skill level was the same as before.From InsiderPHD BugBounty series I saw she mentioned IDOR as a beginner-friendly bug. I didn’t try with IDOR that much before. So it’s a good chance for me to learn something new and do my experiments as well. Why I am not recommending XSS! it’s not actually that beginner-friendly for modern web apps at least not from my experience. I have wasted my previous week with passive BugBounty, maybe earned some $$$ but still, it’s just a waste of time for me so I started doing my experiments as fast and as deep as I canWorkflow Pick a bug then Learn &amp; Earn IDOR CSRF Information Disclosure More you will discover yourself ;-) IDORThis is something where you are able to steal other user data can perform actions on behalf of another user so and so on. Just google a little bit and research your own to understand the basics of IDOR what this issue actually is and why it occurs. After you have learned the basics now see how you can approach to find them!By not touching the target at allWell, this is called passive hunting. You use 3rd party sources to collect data about your target and exploit it depend on what you have. Enough talk let’s give it a shotworkflow Crawl Verify Exploit You can use tools like waybackurls, gau to crawl over your target to collect endpoints and js files. from those js files, you also can collect more endpoints then verify based on their parameters. you can use tools like GF or just manually poke around those endpoints. Then exploit that endpoint depend on its behavior or structure.I just can’t write something like do this, do that, you will find IDOR. I just can show you the general approach there is no fixed way to hack into stuff. you have to figure things out depending on the situation and environment Let me show you mine, how I get one yesterdayLike here you have a JS file. You can use LinkFinder to collect endpoint from that file. Here it clearly shows that it takes input and gives back user info. So what! just have to put a random number that’s all.They applied a temporary fix there and will let me know if that asset was in scope for reward or not. As I expended so far with my recon So it looks like I crossed in scope boundary xDPoking around each and every requestWell, I have exploited another IDOR. That was on their API. I use to get that API endpoint from their main web app. like checking logger++ logs and retesting every request. I am not sure how to show you that IDOR exploitation. As it sounds a little bit sensitive and they are still working on it to fix the issue. Then they will reward for it. I am just giving a SS that shows how things look like. But don’t angry with me if I hide too muchhttps://targetapi/api/path/$username/noticesIt fails to validate the token and give back a response for any client. I know why it still out there even it’s a public RDP program. that endpoint was a little bit confusing to find. Another endpoint was referred to this endpoint so if I didn’t check for all requests I also may miss it as wellOh dude, I can’t write more. I am writing this for the last 2 hours. Seriously I am too much slow. Anyway let’s continueCSRFWith CSRF you fool the victim to do actions that the victim doesn’t want to do at all. My words making no sense! then what stopping you to do some googling!Nowadays you will not see CSRF like before, where no token was available and you just can copy-paste burp CSRF payload and exploit. Now as they are using CSRF tokens so what you can do check if they actually validating CSRF tokens well. it’s so simple and you can use your own creativity to expand the attack methodsI found one on Harvard marked as valid and they resolved as well. But my bad luck that subdomain was out of scope so didn’t receive any letter.Mentioning the reproduce part POC video also available1 login with your account 2 change the email address and capture the requests3 take the CSRF token from /CSRF endpoint and use it in /change email endpoint instead of X-CSRF final token (those token are not same) 4 send a request in /CSRF endpoint again see they change the token5 use that old token in /change-email endpoint6 you see it still working even there is a new CSRF tokenInformation DisclosureAnything that exposes your GF phone number! kidding man, So the thing here is you have to think about what information your target is collecting or giving importance. Then based on that target you can look for several methods to collect maybe some data or at least view something that you should notIt can be separated in two different way Client-Side Information Server-Side Information Client-Side InformationJust aim for the users. look for the places where you can see your own information and then try to play around the request to check if you can view other data instead of your own. it can be some IDOR, SQLI, or whatever. I am not showing you here what you have to do just showing you how to think when you will be there.You are lucky that I have a for you that shows how IDOR can leak clientside informationServer-Side InformationWell, here our main aim is to collect backend data as much as we can. It can be source code, web components, config files, anything that the server will not feel good to give in responseYou can also aim for firewall bypasses to view what the firewall trying to protect from you. It’s not easy as you must have basic understanding well, without knowing the basics you will not get the idea where you have to hit hardI have good findings in this area. Most of the time it was deep FUZZ and 403 bypasses. I have a writeup on 403 bypasses check this out this Guide for bypass 403 endpoints KathanP19/HowToHuntEndNoteEnough dude, I can’t write more. Seriously I can’t even focus on what to write next. I also don’t know how you still reading this. I only can see you are the next Hero of the InfoSec world, who is just going to use his power for the good.Make sure your words and character inspire others. As a BugHunter, you can leave a good impact on society. Oh one more thing, don’t forget your origin &amp; who you was before, support every one of them who supported you when you was lost.

I am a CSE student &amp; doing bug bounties as part time to learn things practically. I am not a pro hunter or a smart guy, so you are free to escape my words.Why you want to become a Bug Hunter ?Well, Its so important. Before starting doing bug bounties, ask yourself why you want to do it. You want do it for only Money! Or you want to do it coz you are passionate with it! or what ?Why I mentioned that, the road map will be different as a bug hunter depending on your interest or aim. What I mean actually, if you want to do it for only money then the path is different if someone want to do it to learn more and feel passionate with itToday I am going to separate those paths and will be showing what type of approaches available.Bug Bounty for Money !Okay, Your aim is only money. You don’t care about the community, you don’t care about the platforms. You just want to do it, as you saw bug hunters are getting paid so high ! Fine, telling you the path thenPassive Bug BountyIf only money is your intention then you can’t earn as a beginner by doing bug bounty actively. My words will make sense later on. just keep the idea on your mind. What I mean by passive bug bounty, you have to take it as a static workflow.Passive Bug Bounty MethodologyPick some non technical bug, keep looking for them on several less crowded programs. You don’t even have to read a single write up. Just collect the reproduce part from of those bugs. And try to reproduce them blindly on tons of programs. If you try them on 1000 programs at least 50 of them will reply you back with something interesting. Cool ha ! no technical work. just put your time and energy get paid!Bug Bounty for learning &amp; passionWell, Here is the time for do some real hard work. If you want to learn by doing bug bounties and you feel like, oh man I am falling love with it. Then this is the path for youActive Bug BountySo now you have to do bug bounty actively. You can’t just relay on non technical low hanging fruits. Even you can’t relay on publicly disclosed vulnerabilities only. You have to get your very own bugs also. Coz now this is the time you are doing kind of research thingsActive Bug Bounty MethodologyFirst of all clear the basics. Like there a lot of things you have to cover. But you can’t do them in one shot or don’t have to. Pick one specific area and dig there then pick another part then another and so and so on. Now put things in a practical and visible wayPick one bug class, Use bug bounty programs as your target to practice. experiment with the knowledge you gained. when you think you are done then move on pick another bug class. so and so onGive me a Break!Hold on this write-up is going wrong ! you don’t feel its a regular write-up right! Didn’t showed anything practical. well till now I was just showing you kind of theatrical ideas. Now time to make hands dirtyPassive ApproachAs you don’t have to do any faking work (sorry for using bad word) just pick an automated framework and keep putting programs.Resources Nuclei Rengine P4 Non Technical Bugs WP Issues Now shut up, pick those bugs and shooting them on tons of programsActive ApproachWell bro, have to do a lot of hard work. This journey will be so painful. All the best. Can’t wait more to see you hitting things harder.Resource focused for Active Bug Bounties BugBountyHunter HowToHunt Learn365 Bug Bounty Playbook OWASP TOP 10 WebSecAcademy TryHackMeEnd NoteThis is the part I, and I just discussed some of the mindset and non technical terms.

So whom this write-up for ! Specially it’s for the beginners like me or someone who just want to get started with bug bounty hunting. I will try my best to add as much reference as i can and will be pointing out all the stuff that gonna happen to you in Bug Bounty Hunting.Index Background Story Lesson What not to do References Reward BackgroundJust letting you know some general info about me, so you can understand what’s going on actually. I just touched 21 in this September. I am a CSE student but if I be honest i am a horrible student. Just passed exams somehow Before doing Bug Bounty i was doing some script kiddies stuff like Defacing random websites with SQLi, shell upload etc etc. But those are not that much bad at all. Those activity now helping me a lot, How! well will discuss soonStoryI was 2019 after waking up from sleep I was scrolling on FaceBook peacefully suddenly I saw a guy named Md Saikat posted on FaceBook about his $25 of Payoneer Bounty. He also was doing BlackHat stuff like me. Then something hit my mind, Well what’s that. He is getting paid for doing what ! Then i asked him and he told me that he found a bug on Payoneer and they paid him $25 for that. Then i asked for how the bug look like. Then he sended a mail of that report on my email address.I picked that bug and reported it on some companies i already knew. One of them replied me with $70 bounty. For me as a college guy that time its enough earning. Cool dude. I want more.So i reported that bug in all BugCrowd public program and all companies i may know. But sadly this time i only got dup and N/A not a single bounty. I got -35 reps from HackerOne. I passed whole month with doing that and ended up by getting nothing. Now just about to give-upWhile scrolling my Facebook news feed I saw a guy named Prial Islam Khan. That guy was smashing with bounties. His profile is just full with swag and $ . That’s so coolI knocked him immediately and asked the most common question that everyone try to avoid. How I can Become a Bug Bounty HunterHe replied me with just a Blog Post called Getting Started 001 . From that day on it just changed my LifeFrom there i started learning about Linux basics, Networking basics, How my computer work, Programming basics, How they communicate etc etc. As i already knew some of them so it was fun for me to discover those old stuff in a detailed way.I study like i never before. Everyday i was passing 12+ hours with only learning those stuff. But here a thing i like to mention. I didn’t passed a good time with labs. what i have done i passed most of my times with real targets. I followed WebSecAcademy to get the general idea first. It not take more then 5–6 hours. then i immediately choose target and start looking for those issues.But i realized that still it not working coz most of the time you will not get that little xss on their main application search bar. It just an example there a lot you can try, but hey i was not getting bugs at all.As i mentioned before i was doing some BlackHat stuff. So during that time what i actually learned is How to solve problems. No matter what, you have to solve it. Riding the whole internet one place to another for a crack games is not easy at all. You face a lot of stuff and get a clean mindset about how things are happening around you. I used that experience to solve now a days most of the problems. It help me to keep digging till i get the ansThe problem with me was that time i didn’t know what recon is. I even didn’t checking for their subdomains. After passing some time with google i saw some methodologies. There they collect subdomains, do asset discovery and so and so on then start their actual manual testing. But i was not doing them and not getting any bugsI started leaning more about recon how it work and what inside. I will attach the references later on. I know recon is not for getting vulnerabilities its for getting as much info as you can. As i saw i am not good with injection type attacks so now this is the only way for me to go ahead.I checked every single stuff available on internet i can. Then i saw most of the time everyone is doing the same. Everyone is using the same tool same approach to perform recon. So if i can do something different then i can win the game. I passed good amount of time to build up a workflow. Every time i was picking some topic to look deep into. Like Subdomain Enumeration, Fuzzing, etc etc. I started getting good bounties after trying in different ways. I don’t do same thing again and again. I pick topic to study then perform them on real target then going for next topic.The only reason to show you those screenshot is, I am using them as reference of my words. Don’t believe random people on info-sec with their words, Believe them with their works. This is only to confirm you that you are not wasting your time on fake stuff at all.Let’s get back to the technical point again! I have the standard view from the community how everyone doing it. Then i have done some experiment see is it still work or not. Most of the time i was ended up having something unique and working. Most of the time my goal was reaching the unseen part of the target or getting stuff that may other missed. I am doing all the stuff Alone. For me its solo vs squad situation. So i also have to train myself like thatBelieve me this game is 20% of Technical Stuff and 80% of Mindset There is no simple word to explain you, how to do the research or how to get things done. Just keep those things on your mind that You should think creative and different and read a lot. Give back to the community. Try Harder and Never give up. You will be in a better positionInshAllahLesson Dont Do it For Money. As you can see i get started by seeing a guy posted his bounty on facebook. But also you saw how things goes wrong with me. Its not possible stay motivated on this field if your only exception is money. Coz you also have to pass good amount of time doing study. And learning new stuff. If you can’t be the Best then be the Beast Take Step Back And Learn new stuff. So all the time your current workflow or what you already know will not work. You may have to do research or uncover the hidden part. Track your activity that you are learning new stuff or not. I am not smart enough to beat you so working hard that you may not beat me Find where you good at. This is the most important part. I was trying all the stuff and tracking where i am doing good. So i can choose it as my primary weapon. Injection attacks worked worse for me but Recon stuff worked well. As same you also should know where you are doing good and where you are failing most. Now i may learn injection attacks with more attention as i know i am weak at it. End of the day i just know i have to do it, How! I don’t know What Not To Do Don’t ask google stuff to people. How to do that, How to do this, don’t ask those type of questions. Just google it read from first page to last page you will get the idea. If you staked with any tool then create a issue on their GitHub repo or read the docs properly. If still you stacked ask them on public places like Tweet about it or Ask on Discord groups. Dont ask random people for their POC video. Well this is important don’t take it as fun. Most of the time POC contain sensitive action or may something that reporter don’t feel comfortable to share. Just ask the theoretical idea or step to reproduce stuff instead of asking the raw POC on your email address. Don’t expect much from people. As you can see it’s really a hard place to work on. Most of the time people are busy with their own pain. So don’t expect someone will feed you with spoon. You have the same internet that other have. If they can then you also Don’t follow random guy on internet. Believe me it will waste a lot of your time. People around you will confuse you in different ways. So make sure you are following less people but the original one. Specially don’t follow random YouTube Hacking channels. wasted a lot of my time there. Personally speaking.

Still let’s talk little bit. I like to manage my Bug Bounty records on Notion** like thisI will not be sharing the whole record as it make no sense. But will give you some idea so you may know what to generally expect. I hacked 19 Company and get paid in cash for 30 Unique bugs. Hacked 4 Company that gives me Swag include Dutch Gov. Hacked 27 Companies that put my name on their HOF. Hacked 5 Company that provided me Certificate as appreciationYou can do more or may less that dosen’t matter.

But I didn’t know how to use it in the real world. As an example, I know this is a loop but how can I use it in real world, that’s my main question to myself. So end of the day, I know the syntax but I don’t know how to deal with it.Everything was running like before, one day somehow I visited a profile on Facebook. There I saw that guy using a specific name for himself everywhere, and that name is really a unique one. I would like to mention that profile so you can understand it clearly. That guy’s profile name is Prial Islam Khan, if you are from Bangladesh and connected with Cyber Security then you already know him.So as you can see he is using prial261 as his unique name. When I search with this name on Google, I saw everything about him.That SEO concept inspired me a lot. Now I also want a unique name for me, so that I can use it everywhere over the internet. Then I start searching a unique name for me. I found some websites there they match your name on different social platform and return you the available social media for use that nameAs you can see I have to give a username again and again till I get the unique one. But it really so boring and I also have to check some other platforms like Hackerone, Bugcrowd, etc for a unique username. So end of the day those websites not helping me to find a unique name for meThen I thought why not I create a tool with python to automate this process. I will learn how to use Python practically and I will also get a unique name for me. Then I start making a tool and I named it UniqMeAs a super-duper noob, I actually didn’t know where and how to start. I draw a concept on my mind that, I will take input from the user then I will generate a list of names based on that input and finally I will match them on different websites. I start googling about how to generate a list with python, how to check website response with python etc.After lots of failing attempts finally, I wrote a script that giving me available names from Hackerone, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram. I tried a lot with Bugcrowd but it gave me a 403 status code. Still, it’s not the main problem, the main problem is this tool is super duper slow and not showing the result while matching the usernames. It’s really so boring and not that much fun.Again after lots of failing attempts finally it working smoothly at least better than before. So now let’s see the codes how actually it works I imported the module requests and store all the websites in variable Then I set some condition to generate the name list with requests I send the names to the websites then if it gives 404 it means that name is not available there so I can use that name Last but not the least I filter and print all the names that can be used in all websitesThat’s how I create my first tool with Python. I found a unique name for me. It’s mehedi1194So end of the day I also have a unique name.If you are also searching for a unique name then it may help you. I am giving this tool link belowThank You for reading till the endBe Secure Be SafeAllah HafizUniqMe : https://uniqme.netlify.comwanna support my work! well just buy me a coffee" } ]
